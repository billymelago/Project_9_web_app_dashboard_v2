# Project_9_web_app_dashboard_v2
Web App
Many websites do more than just give you information. Sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint and Treehouse let users do things. They act like programs you run on your computer. These web applications, often include pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These "dashboards" act like your control panel for controlling the web app.

In this project, you'll take a mockup and a few icons and build a beautiful, web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. You only need to take the design and create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this one page -- you don't need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.

Hi William,

Absolutely excellent work so far! Your Web App Dashboard project is fantastic! Your widgets are on point and your graphs are great. I love all the extra color and thoughtful additions. Nice work adding functional links to the nav. You've demonstrated some great creativity and drive here. And you're so close! There was just one small CSS validation error, detailed above, that is keeping this project form passing with an exceeds grade. Go ahead and wrap that up and you should be good to go.

Good luck, happy coding, and keep up the great work, William! You've got this! :)
